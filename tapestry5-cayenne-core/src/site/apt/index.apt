Tapestry5-Cayenne Core Module

	The core module provides the basic set of functionality for the server and client modules.  The core module is not used directly.
	Instead, it is loaded in transitively by maven or is included with the client and server assemblies.
	
	Most of the service implementations and components that this project provides are housed in the core module.
